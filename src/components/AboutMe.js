        <p>I'm a full stack web developer based in Atlanta</p>
        <p>
        I dive into each project with a voracious desire to understand and
        solve each hurdle that arises. I pair that desire with a creative eye
        that constantly asks how to make a design more intuitive and the user
        experience more gratifying.
        </p>
        <p>
        With a background as a financial advisor, I bring an empathetic,
        trustworthy demeanor to team environments thatâ€™s coupled with the
        data-driven, analytical mind of solo projects.
        </p>
        <p>
        An eye for design and detail. Eager to grow, learn, and constantly
        refining techniques and adding more to my repertoire.
        </p></AboutFlex>
