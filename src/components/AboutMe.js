          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>I'm a full stack web developer based in Atlanta.</p>
          <p>
            I recently finished 500+ hours of intense, deadline-driven training
            through General Assembly's Web Developer Immersive course.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a background as a financial advisor, I bring an empathetic,
            trustworthy demeanor to team environments thatâ€™s coupled with the
            data-driven, analytical mind of solo projects.
          </p>
          <p>An eye for design and detail.</p>
          <p>
            Eager to grow, learn, and constantly refining techniques and adding
            more to my repertoire.
          </p>
        </AboutFlex>
      </AboutMeContainer>
